# Json
Json is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation.
It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.
Json can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of.

### Goals
  * Provide simple `format()` and `parse()` methods to convert Java objects to JSON and vice-versa
  * Allow pre-existing unmodifiable objects to be converted to and from JSON
  * Extensive support of Java Generics
  * Allow custom representations for objects
  * Support arbitrarily complex objects (with deep inheritance hierarchies and extensive use of generic types)

### Download
